## 📘 Overview
The **Employee Management System (EMS)** is a simple **console-based Java application** designed to help beginners understand core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as *classes, objects, encapsulation, and data handling*.  
It allows users to manage employee information — including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting records — all stored in an in-memory `ArrayList`.

This project demonstrates how CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and validation logic can be implemented in Java with a text-based user interface.
